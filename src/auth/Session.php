/**
 * Defines a session handler.
 *
 * This handler is completly decoupled from PHP's session handler.
 * It does not provide any means of storing the session id, which must be
 * done manually in order to restore a session. This allows you to use the handler
 * for more than just HTTP requests as this handler does not force send cookies to the client.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      This example uses the HTTP package from IMPHP.
 *
 *      ```php
 *      $request = new ServerRequestBuilder();
 *      $cookie = new CookieHandler();
 *      $cookie->readFromRequest($request);
 *
 *      $sessid = $cookie->get("sessid");
 *      $session = new FileSession($sessid);
 *
 *      if ($session->get("state") == "loggedin") {
 *          // ...
 *      }
 *      ```
 *
 * @var string $id
 *      Read-only property that stores the current session id
